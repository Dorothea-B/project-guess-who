# Guessing game

For this weeks assignment my main objective was to set up and understand all the javascript functionalities. Therefore I kept the template as is.

Once I finished that, I decided to try and make my own version. In the spirit of valentine's day I made a 'guess who' of my exes ðŸ˜…
I'm having trouble getting it to work, though, which is why I decided to upload both.

## The problem

I think the issue has to do with how I structured the options. I have only two question categories, one of which has three options and are either/or. The other category is unnamed and have only boolean questions. I think I've messed up how to reference them. 

The select-values needs to replace the select-labels when filtering my characters, and the select-values needs to be replaced by true/false. Each value also needs its own if/else statement and custom alert, testing for true or false. I tried to declare them as "attributes" unsuccessfully. The relationship-category promts the alert but doesn't filter characters. The "---" doesn't function at all. Hopefully I can revisit the project in a couple of weeks and identify the problem, or get some feedback on how to solve it in my code review.
